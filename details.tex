\section{Cost Breakdown}

At Viridity Capital LLC, we strive to be very efficient with 

\subsection{Direct Labor}

We have calculated the 2000 hrs worked as 2080 hrs minus 10 Federal holidays
for the year. 

It is noted that the CEO has significantly more responsibilities
than the engineers, as he has to meet with stakeholders, provide roadmap,
planning, and also is an engineer as well.

\subsection{Indirect Costs}

We will need to purchase compute for hosting the website, storing data in
databases, and providing analytics. We will be using a combination of AWS
Lambdas and Elastic Beanstalk. We have estimated \$10,000 a month for the
compute costs as we have seen similarly scaled businesses use around that much
for their services which provide websites with analytics for users worldwide.

We will save costs by having employees use our own laptops to work
on. The company has agreed that we don't need to provide benefits to the
employees as well to additionally save costs. We will also choose to forgo
purchasing subscriptions for coworking space such as WeWork.

We will have travel taken by all members once a month to meet in person. As we
have workers in New York City and Washington DC, we will travel by train. The
Per Diem cost includes hotel and food for the day.
